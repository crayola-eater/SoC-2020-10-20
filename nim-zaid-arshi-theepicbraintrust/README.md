# NIM

Our challenge is to fill in the empty classes to make an implementation of the game nim in an object oriented way. A player should be able to play against the computer.

Nim is game where two or more players take turns picking up either one or two coins from a pile. The winner is the player to take the last coin.

## Task

Every file except for `main.js` contains an empty class. Your job is to break down what state that class needs to keep track of, and what actions it needs to perform.

The game interaction for this stage should be through `alert`, `prompt` and/or `confirm`.

## Bonus

Refactor your code to use the DOM to display information and get user input.
